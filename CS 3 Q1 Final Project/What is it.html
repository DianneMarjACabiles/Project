    <h2 class="smalldesc">
      Gender equality is the state of equal ease of access to resources and opportunities regardless of gender. 
      It means that the rights, responsibilities and opportunities of individuals will not depend on whether they are male or female.

    <h3 class="desc">To understand gender inequality, here are examples of gender inequality:</h3>

    <ul>
      <section>
        <li>Unfair pay wage</li>
        <h3 class="desc">
          According to the data from UN Women Worldwide, women only make 77 cents for every dollar earned by men. 
          There's an unfair gap between women's and men's wages. 
          This could lead to women not being able to support their family as well as men could. 
          This is even more unfortunate for the women out there who are single mothers.
        </h3>
      </section>

      <section>
        <li>"Pink tax" for women</li>
        <h3 class="desc">
          "Pink tax" is when products that are marketed towards women are more expensive. 
          There are videos on social media where women compare the prices between the version of a product that is marketed towards women compared to the one marketed towards men.
          Despite being the exact same product, the one targeted towards women is somehow more expensive.
        </h3>

        <li>Sexual harassment towards men</li>
        <h3 class="desc">
          Both women and men can get sexually harassed. However, it seems that SA, or sexual assault, towards men is less recognized and believed. 
          There was a video on social media where a boy talks about how he was sexually assaulted by his aunt. 
          However, since men are usually seen as the ones who do SA and not women, people around him didn't believe him. 
          It is also obvious that when someone thinks of sexual harassment, they will most likely think of women being the victims. 
          Although women do get unfortunately harassed like that too, it doesn't mean men can't experience that as well.
        </h3>

      <section>
        <li>Paternity leave stigma</li>
        <h3 class="desc">
          Fathers are parents too, but paternity leave is stigmatized. 
          According to research done by the website Futureheads, paternity leave allows dads to build a strong bond with their newborns and share childcare responsibilities more equally. 
          Studies have shown that fathers who take paternity leave report stronger emotional connections with their children. 
          They can also help their wives who just gave birth, as they have challenges due to postpartum changes.
        </h3>
      </section>
    </ul>

    <aside>
      <h3 class="desc">
        Gender inequality includes removing the inequalities such as what was mentioned above. 
        It calls for the equal enjoyment of socially valued opportunities, resources, rewards, and products by both men and women. 
        People shouldn't be treated differently just because of their gender.
