    <h2 class="smalldesc">
      Morality is following the principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior.

    <ul>
      <section>
        <li>It is related to human dignity</li>
        <h3 class="desc">
          Recognizing human dignity means recognizing every human has value and worth. 
          Denying equality diminishes a person's inherent value, which is morally wrong.

      <section>
        <li>It is related to compassion and empathy</li>
        <h3 class="desc">
          Compassion and empathy are both moral virtues. 
          Being a misogynist makes someone biased toward men, while being a misandrist makes a person biased toward women. 
          If one is biased towards a certain gender, it hinders them from giving someone the compassion and empathy they deserve.

      <section>
        <li>Being against gender equality means treating people unfairly</li>
        <h3 class="desc">
          If morality is based on the good beliefs and ideas that are agreed upon by the majority of people, 
          wouldn’t treating people unfairly for a certain trait that isn’t even bad go against the belief that we should treat people fairly?
        </h3>
      </section>

      <section>
        <li>Moral people have the responsibility and willingness to oppose injustice</li>
        <h3 class="desc">
          Injustice, by definition, is a lack of fairness or justice. 
          Being against gender equality makes you lack in those two things. 
          How can someone call themself a moral person then?
