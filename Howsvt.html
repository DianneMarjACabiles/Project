      Society has many different views on gender equality. While some people support it and push for progress, others still hold onto traditional beliefs or misunderstand what it really means. The points below explore some of the common attitudes and issues surrounding gender equality today.

        <li>There are some generational differences</li>
        <h3 class="desc">
          In my own experience, I have observed that more of the older generations do not uphold gender equality that much. 
          Although they do agree that women should not be abused, they still normalize the talk about traditional gender norms. 
          However, there are still people in the current generation who don’t quite uphold it, or some of them have been misinformed, which will be explained in the next point below.

        <li>People have misconceptions about it, especially regarding feminism, due to social media</li>
        <h3 class="desc">
          There are a lot of people who’ve been misinformed about the true nature of gender equality because of social media, especially on feminism. 
          Some have mistaken feminism as hating men and being biased to women, when feminism means wanting to be EQUAL to men. 
          The wrong description of feminism I pointed out is called misandry, which is the opposite of misogyny, but is just as bad. 
          I’ve also seen men saying that they don’t support feminism because they have fallen into the misinformation that feminism means hating men. 
          Being a feminist does not require hating the male gender.

        <h3 class="desc">
          Women statistically still have lower wages than men. 
          A lot of our leaders, whether it be in your local area or even the country, are male. 
          There is still less female leadership representation in our politics. 
          Furthermore, topics like male mental health, paternity leave, and sexual assault against men are often minimized or ignored. 
          Traditional household roles are still being brought up today.

        <li>Increasing awareness and support</li>
        <h3 class="desc">
          Despite the challenges, it cannot be denied that gender equality is being talked about more than ever. 
          There is even a whole month celebrating female rights. 
          Although we are still fighting to make gender equality more normalized, we are still
