<h1 class="title"> Why gender equality? </h1>

<hr>
</header>

<h3 class="desc">Here are some reasons:</h3>

<ul>
    <section>
     <li>People’s skills will be more recognized.    </li>
     <h3 class="desc">With gender equality, the accomplishments of women and men will be acknowledged equally.

        As we know, women were seen as inferior in the past. 
               
    </h3>
    <h4
    class="2024">"How many Einsteins have spent their lives washing dishes? How many mozarts bent over stoves instead of pianos because they had the misfortune of being born a woman?"

    <h3 class="desc">Some jobs are stereotyped as “women jobs” such as nurses or secretaries. Because of that, the men who occupy the fields can be underestimated simply for their gender. 

        Who knows? Some people are actually amazing at a certain job, but were hindered because of their gender.
        </h3>
    </section>
    
    <section>
     <li>Freedom of expression</li>
     <h3
     class="desc">“You can’t do that because you’re a woman/man” will not be there anymore. Women and men will be treated equally and therefore having more freedom to express themselves. It will make people feel safer and reassured that they won’t be judged.
    </h3>



     <li>It is related to human rights</li>
     <h3 class="desc">According to the website United Nations, human rights is defined as rights inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, sex, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, or any other status. This also applies to gender. That is therefore related to human rights.
    </h3>
    </section>
    
    <section>
    <li>A better society in general
    </li>
     <h3 class="desc">Through gender equality, we can achieve peaceful societies and an overall better life. 
        Unfortunate people such as single mothers will be given equal pay, and therefore being able to raise their children properly. Men’s struggles will be heard, just like how women are. Everyone will be happier and more united.
    </ul>
