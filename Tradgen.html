    <h2 class="smalldesc">
      The concept of gender roles is deeply rooted in our history, shaping the way men and women have been treated over time. 
      These roles are based on societal expectations about how individuals should behave depending on whether they are male or female.

        <li>Household roles</li>
        <h3 class="desc">
          Women are expected to cook, clean, and care for their children at the same time. 
          They are expected and pressured to have children. 
          There is even a very misogynistic quote that 'Women belong in the kitchen'. 
          On the other hand, the male role is that they are the one who works for the family. 
          This shows how drastically different their workload in a household setting is. 
          The man has plenty of time to take care of himself, while his wife has to do household chores daily, 
          while also be handed the difficult and time-consuming responsibility of taking care of a child.

        <li>Traditional femininity and masculinity in personalities</li>
        <h3 class="desc">
          Women are expected to be kind, quiet, soft, and even stereotyped as weak. 
          Men, on the other hand, are expected to be strong, tough, and emotionally reserved. 
          These are such bad concepts to follow because women CAN be strong and men DO have emotions, 
          but some people might belittle them for it. 
          These traditional feminine and masculine traits make it sound like a certain group of people 
          with the same gender have the same characteristics and personalities, when in fact, they can be very different.

        <li>There are 'feminine' and 'masculine jobs'</li>
        <h3 class="desc">
          Traditionally feminine jobs are secretaries, housekeepers, nurses, etc. 
          Traditional masculine jobs are plumbers, mechanics, and truck drivers. 
          In reality, anyone can do these jobs if they have the skill and understanding. 
          You do not need to use your private part to do these, so why does it matter?

        <li>Fashion styles are stereotyped</li>
        <h3 class="desc">
          Certain types of clothing and styles are often associated with a specific gender. 
          For example, skirts, dresses, and makeup are commonly linked to women, 
          while suits and bold, structured styles are typically associated with men. 
          Wearing something that is not usually associated with a certain gender might come with some hate. 
          However, realistically, there is no harm in dressing a certain way; it is only the fault of our judgemental society.

      <section>
        <li>'Covering up'</li>
        <h3 class="desc">
          This is such a prevalent concept, which is one of the ones still common today. 
          Women have been told to 'cover up' so as not to tempt men into viewing them sexually. 
          But, even when fully covered up, there are still those who are sexually assaulted. 
          There are videos on the internet showing what people were wearing when they were sexually assaulted, 
          and some of them were fully covered up. 
          This shows that no matter how much someone covers up, it will be the same. 
          Women do not wear short clothing for men, and that should not be the mentality. 
          Instead of always talking about protecting your daughter, you should educate your son.
